# TheDeveloper10/mamba

Package `TheDeveloper10/mamba` is a very basic wrapper of the package `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4` that adds encryption and decryption functionality on top of it. It makes the work with JWT much easier!

## Install
With a [correctly configured](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing) Go toolchain:

```sh
go get -u github.com/TheDeveloper10/mamba@v1.0.0
```
